There are three types of dependency Injections which can be performed in Spring
1.Constructor Based
This is the most recommended approach by spring team as all the initialisation happens in one go. @Autowired is also not required
for this method.As Constructor creates Objects which can be treated as Beans by SpringBoot.
2.Setter Based
We need to use Setters for each Bean that are required to create and we need to use Auto wired  as well
3.Field Based( we use @Autowired) for this one.
This approach just requires an @Autowired on top of the dependencies.
