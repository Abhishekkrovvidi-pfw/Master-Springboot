Lets assume we have different environments such as
dev env
QA env
Test env
Stage env
Prod env
We can use profiles for this kind of scenario. so we create different application.properties files.
there are different levels
trace(prints everything in logs)
debug
info
warning
error(only errors are printed in logs)
off(it turns off logs)
